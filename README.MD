### About the Data:
The data used for this project is provided by Divvy, the company who operates the ride sahres and can be found here:  https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

Because of the large data size (9.5 billion samples), I have reformatted the data into a more compact form so that it can be used more efficiently in a realtime visualization.  The file size of the original data is aproximatetly 1GB, and in it's reformated state it is only 24KB. You can view the data in it's reformatted state here: https://github.com/OwenBrush/data_analysis_divvy_bike_usage/blob/main/compact_bike_data.csv

I have also retrieved covid data from the city of chicago, which can be found here: https://data.cityofchicago.org/

Weather data was accquired from the meteostat python libraries, but was not used in the final visualization.
